This should be solved using Python. Problem 2 You are on a diet and can only eat 750 calories per day. There are food items that you enjoy more than others.

Problem 2

You are on a diet and can only eat 750 calories per day. There are food items that you enjoy more than others. The following table lists the value and calories of each kind of food:

Food          Value   Calories
wine          89      123
beer          90      154
pizza         30      258
burger        50      354
fries         90      365
coke          79      150
apple         90      95
donut         10      195

Create a program that selects the optimal mix of food items that will maximize your value, and not exceed the limit of 750 calories. Assume that you can pick at most one of each kind of food.
