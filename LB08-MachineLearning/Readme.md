* The course [Machine Learning CS229 at Stanford](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) is one of the most popular machine learning courses created by **Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera** and founder of deeplearning.ai. There is a free variant available at [Coursera](https://de.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), given by Andrew Ng himself.
> *Fantastic intro to the fundamentals of machine learning. If you want to take your understanding of machine learning concepts beyond "model.fit(X, Y), model.predict(X)" then this is the course for you. (David W.)*

* [Machine Learning - An online comic from Google AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1). **A comic strip** approach to machine learning? Could it possibly work? The hero is a cat, so of course it can. Have fun. 
There is also a free [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) at Google  

* On [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning) you'll also find a lot of well done and free online courses for Machine Learning and related topics. Note **edX** was started in 2012 by Professor Anant Agarwal and colleagues from MIT and Harvard as a platform that would offer their courses online, open to any person up to the challenge, for free.

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.Is was initiated in 2009 and in the field of computer sciences and mathematics.. Note: scikit-learn has received a [prize for open-source scientific software from the French Government](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/remise-des-prix-science-ouverte-du-logiciel-libre-de-la-recherche/) in february 2022. This is great recognition for all the community of contributors and users of a project born in France.  

* The [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The tidyverse collection was initiated by Hadley Wickham an Assistant Professor at Rice University and an active memberof the R community. See the free online version of his excellent book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) on how to do data science with R

* For [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/), you'll find a lot of well curated video tutorials, e.g. [Behind the Scenes of Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/XtOmoIibsGk). See also the excellent book of Rosaria Silipo, Principal Data Scientist and Head of Evangelism at KNIME AG, [Guide to Intelligent Data Science](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-45574-3)

## C) Datasets   
* [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.

 The archive was created as an ftp archive in 1987 by UCI PhD student David Aha. Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators, and researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning datasets.

## D) Links   
* [Insane Cheat Sheet Collection](https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2020/12/machine-learning-and-data-science-cheat-sheets-pdf.html#) A curated list of 100+ machine learning and data science cheatsheet. The InsaneApp team researched for more than a month to find out all the cheat sheets on machine learning, deep learning, data mining, neural networks, big data, artificial intelligence, python, tensorflow, scikit-learn, etc from all over the web.
