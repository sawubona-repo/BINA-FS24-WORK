i found a love for me
darling just dive right in
and follow my lead
well i found a girl beautiful and sweet
i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
because we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling  just kiss me slow  your heart is all i own
and in your eyes you are holding mine
baby  i am dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass  listening to our favorite song
when you said you looked a mess  i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it  darling  you look perfect tonight
well i found a woman  stronger than anyone i know
she shares my dreams  i hope that someday i will share her home
i found a love  to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love  to carry children of our own
we are still kids  but we are so in love
fighting against all odds
i know we will be alright this time
darling  just hold my hand
be my girl  i will be your man
i see my future in your eyes
baby  i am dancing in the dark  with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass  listening to our favorite song
when i saw you in that dress  looking so beautiful
i do not deserve this  darling  you look perfect tonight
baby  i am dancing in the dark  with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass  listening to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect
i do not deserve this
you look perfect tonight
