Inspiration
	With the attributes described below, you predict if a patient has heart disease?

age: age in years

sex
-- 1: male
-- 0: female


cp: chest pain type
-- Value 0: typical angina
-- Value 1: atypical angina
-- Value 2: non-anginal pain
-- Value 3: asymptomatic

trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 
-- 1: true
-- 0: false

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach:  maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina 
-- 1 = yes
-- 0 = no

oldpeak =  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest


slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-- Value 0: upsloping
-- Value 1: flat
-- Value 2: downsloping

ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy


thal (Thalium -  a radioactive tracer injected during a stress test)
#  I'll copy a sentence so you get more insight about the "thal" column (thal is for Thalium, a radioactive tracer injected during a stress test):
# Nuclear stress testing requires the injection of a tracer, commonly technicium 99M (Myoview or Cardiolyte), 
# which is then taken up by healthy, viable myocardial cells. 
# A camera (detector) is used afterwards to image the heart and compare segments. 
# A coronary stenosis is detected when a myocardial segment takes up the nuclear tracer at rest, but not during cardiac stress. 
# This is called a "reversible defect." Scarred myocardium from prior infarct will not take up tracer at all and is referred to as a "fixed defect"
-- Value 0 = normal
-- Value 1 = fixed defect
-- Value 2 = reversable defect

condition (maybe THE most important feature): 
-- 0 = no disease
-- 1 = disease
